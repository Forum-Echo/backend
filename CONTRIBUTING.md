# Contributing Guidelines

## Basic Informations
We use the [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
branching strategy.

## Branches
### main (default branch)
- not pushable
- contains production code

### dev (active developement)
- contains code of future releases

### Feature branch (ever feature has its on)
- for every new feature collection, a new one gets created
- after the feature is finished, it gets merged into dev and deleted
